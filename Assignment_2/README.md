## Assignment 2 - Machine learning

I've chosen to work with case 1, predicting stock market price for Norwegian airlines. 

The goal is to predict the closing stock market price. The prediction values are continues and therefore i've used supervised machine learning with regression algorithms to solve it. 

To begin with i prepared the data by doing feature engineering on the NAS.csv. Afterwards i trained a linear regression model and a polynominal regression model.
