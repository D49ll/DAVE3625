## Assignment 2 - Machine learning

I've chosen to work with case 1, predicting stock market price for Norwegian airlines. 

The goal is to predict closing stock market price in the future. The prediction values are continues and therefore i've used supervised machine learning with regression algorithms to solve this. 

To begin with i prepared the data by doing feature engineering on the NAS.csv. Afterwards i trained a linear regression model and a polynominal regression model.
